# CaptainGame

This simple app demonstrates the use of Composable functions, State, Recomposition, Remember, MutableState, and more. 

## How to play

Use the North, South, East, and West buttons to move the "ship" around. There is a random chance you will either encounter a treasure  and gain or a storm.

I added a 'Current HP' counter that starts at 10 and either goes up when you encounter a treasure or down when you encounter a storm.
